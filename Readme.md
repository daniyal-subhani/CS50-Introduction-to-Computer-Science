# CS50x â€” Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my notes, solutions, and projects from [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's introduction to computer science.  

CS50 is about learning how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently.  
Throughout the course, Iâ€™ll be working with concepts like:
- Algorithms & Data Structures  
- Memory & Resource Management  
- Abstraction & Encapsulation  
- Security & Software Engineering  
- Web Development  

The course uses several languages and technologies:
- **C**
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**

Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains such as cryptography, finance, biology, and gaming.  
The final project will tie everything together into a real application.

ðŸ“Œ This repo will track my progress step by step â€” problem sets, notes, and experiments.
